We want others to be able to understand our code, so when generating code, always include the necessary comments and documentation. Maintain architectural and design diagrams in the doc/diagrams directory using mermaid.js. Use markdown for documentation. Use marp for presentations and put them in the docs/presentations folder. 

Use TypeScript for code. Use Vitest for testing. Use pnpm for package management. Use AWS CDK v2 for infrastructure. Use SOLID principles for design. Use clean code principles for implementation. Use best practices for security and performance. Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting. Use commitizen for commit messages. Use semantic-release for versioning and changelogs.
