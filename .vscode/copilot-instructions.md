We want others to be able to understand our code, so when generating code, always include the necessary comments and documentation. Maintain architectural and design diagrams in the doc/diagrams directory using mermaid.js. Use markdown for documentation. Use marp for presentations and put them in the docs/presentations folder. 

Use TypeScript for code. Use Vitest for testing. Use pnpm for package management. Use AWS CDK v2 for infrastructure. Use SOLID principles for design. Use clean code principles for implementation. Use best practices for security and performance. Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting. Use commitizen for commit messages. Use semantic-release for versioning and changelogs.

We want maintainable code, so add JSDoc @deprecated tags to outdated functions to provide clear deprecation warnings in code editors.

If a test suite requires changes to environment variables, ensure that the test suite cleans up after itself by resetting the environment variables to their original state. This is crucial for maintaining a clean and consistent testing environment, especially when running tests in parallel or in different environments.
